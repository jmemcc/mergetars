# Mergetars

Mergetars is a command-line utility program that merges the contents of multiple archive files into a single tar archive.

It was originally authored under CITS2002, the University of Western Australia's second-year systems programming unit run by Dr. Chris McDonald.

It has since been updated by its original authors to include several new features.
